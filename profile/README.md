# ADB Data Division (ERDD)

The **Data Division (ERDD)** at the **Asian Development Bank (ADB)** works across the full data cycle â€” from data collection and processing to management, application, and dissemination. Our mission is to generate high-quality data and insights that inform better policymaking across Asia and the Pacific.

We undertake methodological research in statistics and data science to shed light on critical development issues such as:

- Climate change  
- Poverty and inequality  
- Food security  
- Globalization  
- The digital economy  

We also publish ADBâ€™s annual flagship **Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific** and other data-driven knowledge products.

In addition, ERDD plays a key role in strengthening statistical capacity across the region, delivering workshops attended by more than **1,000 participants annually**.
